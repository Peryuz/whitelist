# AZERO.ID â€“ Early Tester Whitelist

This repository contains the whitelist rewarded to:

- all addresses that claimed a testnet domain until the snapshot (2022-11-30 17:47:50.001000 +00:00 at block number 17022533), and
- all addresses that successfully participated in our second private testnet phase.

Every user on the whitelist will be able to claim one 5+ character domain before AZERO.ID is open to the general public. Claiming a domain will be on a first come first serve basis. The early tester claiming days will start approx. 7 days before the official launch. We announce the exact date closer to the launch.
