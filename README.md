# AZERO Domains â€“ Early Tester Whitelist

Every user on the whitelist will be able to claim one 5+ character domain before AZERO Domains is opened to the general public. Claiming a domain will be on a first come first serve basis. The early tester claiming days will start 7 days before the official launch. We announce the exact date closer to the launch.
